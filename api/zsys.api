        Callback for interrupt signal handler
        <argument name = "signal_value" type = "integer" />
    </callback_type>

    <method name = "init" singleton = "1">
        Initialize CZMQ zsys layer; this happens automatically when you create
        a socket or an actor; however this call lets you force initialization
        earlier, so e.g. logging is properly set-up before you start working.
        Not threadsafe, so call only from main thread. Safe to call multiple
        times. Returns global CZMQ context.
        <return type = "anything" />
    </method>

    <method name = "shutdown" singleton = "1">
        Optionally shut down the CZMQ zsys layer; this normally happens automatically
        when the process exits; however this call lets you force a shutdown
        earlier, avoiding any potential problems with atexit() ordering, especially
        with Windows dlls.
    </method>

    <method name = "socket" singleton = "1">
        Get a new ZMQ socket, automagically creating a ZMQ context if this is
        the first time. Caller is responsible for destroying the ZMQ socket
        before process exits, to avoid a ZMQ deadlock. Note: you should not use
        this method in CZMQ apps, use zsock_new() instead.

    <method name = "create pipe" singleton = "1">
        Create a pipe, which consists of two PAIR sockets connected over inproc.

        <return type = "zsock" />
    </method>

    <method name = "handler set" singleton = "1">
        Set interrupt handler; this saves the default handlers so that a
        zsys_handler_reset () can restore them. If you call this multiple times
        then the last handler will take affect. If handler_fn is NULL, disables
        default SIGINT/SIGTERM handling in CZMQ.

    <method name = "catch interrupts" singleton = "1">
        Set default interrupt handler, so Ctrl-C or SIGTERM will set
        zsys_interrupted. Idempotent; safe to call multiple times.
        Can be suppressed by ZSYS_SIGHANDLER=false
        *** This is for CZMQ internal use only and may change arbitrarily ***
    </method>

    <method name = "is interrupted" singleton = "1" state = "draft">
        Check if default interrupt handler of Ctrl-C or SIGTERM was called.

    </method>

    <method name = "set interrupted" singleton = "1" state = "draft">
        Set interrupted flag. This is done by default signal handler, however

    <method name = "udp new" singleton = "1">
        Create UDP beacon socket; if the routable option is true, uses
        multicast (not yet implemented), else uses broadcast. This method
        and related ones might _eventually_ be moved to a zudp class.
        *** This is for CZMQ internal use only and may change arbitrarily ***

        Receive zframe from UDP socket, and set address of peer that sent it
        The peername must be a char [INET_ADDRSTRLEN] array if IPv6 is disabled or
        NI_MAXHOST if it's enabled. Returns NULL when failing to get peer address.

    </method>

    <method name = "hostname" singleton = "1">
        Return current host name, for use in public tcp:// endpoints. Caller gets

        <return type = "string" mutable = "1" />
    </method>

    <method name = "daemonize" singleton = "1">
        Move the current process into the background. The precise effect depends
        on the operating system. On POSIX boxes, moves to a specified working
        directory (if specified), closes all file handles, reopens stdin, stdout,
        and stderr to the null device, and sets the process to ignore SIGHUP. On
        Windows, does nothing. Returns 0 if OK, -1 if there was an error.

    </method>

    <method name = "set io threads" singleton = "1">
        Configure the number of I/O threads that ZeroMQ will use. A good
        rule of thumb is one thread per gigabit of traffic in or out. The
        default is 1, sufficient for most applications. If the environment
        variable ZSYS_IO_THREADS is defined, that provides the default.
        Note that this method is valid only before any socket is created.
        <argument name = "io_threads" type = "size" />

    </method>

    <method name = "set max sockets" singleton = "1">
        Configure the number of sockets that ZeroMQ will allow. The default
        is 1024. The actual limit depends on the system, and you can query it
        by using zsys_socket_limit (). A value of zero means "maximum".
        Note that this method is valid only before any socket is created.
        <argument name = "max sockets" type = "size" />

    <method name = "set file stable age msec" singleton = "1" state = "draft">
        Configure the threshold value of filesystem object age per st_mtime
        that should elapse until we consider that object "stable" at the
        current zclock_time() moment.
        The default is S_DEFAULT_ZSYS_FILE_STABLE_AGE_MSEC defined in zsys.c
        which generally depends on host OS, with fallback value of 5000.
        <argument name = "file stable age msec" type = "msecs" />
    </method>

    <method name = "file stable age msec" singleton = "1" state = "draft">

        before testing if a filesystem object is "stable" or not.
        <return type = "msecs" />
    </method>

    <method name = "set linger" singleton = "1">
        Configure the default linger timeout in msecs for new zsock instances.
        You can also set this separately on each zsock_t instance. The default
        linger time is zero, i.e. any pending messages will be dropped. If the
        environment variable ZSYS_LINGER is defined, that provides the default.
        Note that process exit will typically be delayed by the linger time.
        <argument name = "linger" type = "size" />
    </method>

    <method name = "set sndhwm" singleton = "1">
        Configure the default outgoing pipe limit (HWM) for new zsock instances.
        You can also set this separately on each zsock_t instance. The default
        HWM is 1,000, on all versions of ZeroMQ. If the environment variable
        ZSYS_SNDHWM is defined, that provides the default. Note that a value of
        zero means no limit, i.e. infinite memory consumption.

        Configure the default HWM for zactor internal pipes; this is set on both
        ends of the pipe, for outgoing messages only (sndhwm). The default HWM is
        1,000, on all versions of ZeroMQ. If the environment var ZSYS_ACTORHWM is
        defined, that provides the default. Note that a value of zero means no
        limit, i.e. infinite memory consumption.

        <return type = "size" />
    </method>

    <method name = "set ipv6" singleton = "1">
        Configure use of IPv6 for new zsock instances. By default sockets accept
        and make only IPv4 connections. When you enable IPv6, sockets will accept
        and connect to both IPv4 and IPv6 peers. You can override the setting on
        each zsock_t instance. The default is IPv4 only (ipv6 set to 0). If the
        environment variable ZSYS_IPV6 is defined (as 1 or 0), this provides the
        default. Note: has no effect on ZMQ v2.
        <argument name = "ipv6" type = "integer" />

    <method name = "set interface" singleton = "1">
        Set network interface name to use for broadcasts, particularly zbeacon.
        This lets the interface be configured for test environments where required.
        For example, on Mac OS X, zbeacon cannot bind to 255.255.255.255 which is
        the default when there is no specified interface. If the environment
        variable ZSYS_INTERFACE is set, use that as the default interface name.
        Setting the interface to "*" means "use all available interfaces".

    <method name = "set ipv6 address" singleton = "1">
        Set IPv6 address to use zbeacon socket, particularly for receiving zbeacon.
        This needs to be set IPv6 is enabled as IPv6 can have multiple addresses
        on a given interface. If the environment variable ZSYS_IPV6_ADDRESS is set,
        use that as the default IPv6 address.

    <method name = "set auto use fd" singleton = "1">
        Configure the automatic use of pre-allocated FDs when creating new sockets.
        If 0 (default), nothing will happen. Else, when a new socket is bound, the
        system API will be used to check if an existing pre-allocated FD with a
        matching port (if TCP) or path (if IPC) exists, and if it does it will be
        set via the ZMQ_USE_FD socket option so that the library will use it

    </method>

    <method name = "zplprintf" singleton = "1" state = "draft">
        Print formatted string. Format is specified by variable names
        in Python-like format style

        "%(KEY)s=%(VALUE)s", KEY=key, VALUE=value
        become
        "key=value"

        Returns freshly allocated string or NULL in a case of error.
        Not enough memory, invalid format specifier, name not in args
        <argument name = "format" type = "string" />
        <argument name = "args" type = "zconfig" />
        <return type = "string" fresh = "1" />
    </method>

    <method name = "zplprintf_error" singleton = "1" state = "draft">
        Return error string for given format/args combination.

        <argument name = "format" type = "string" />
        <argument name = "args" type = "zconfig" />
        <return type = "string" fresh = "1" />
    </method>

    <method name = "set logident" singleton = "1">
        Set log identity, which is a string that prefixes all log messages sent
        by this process. The log identity defaults to the environment variable
        ZSYS_LOGIDENT, if that is set.
        <argument name = "value" type = "string" />
    </method>

    <method name = "set logstream" singleton = "1">
        Set stream to receive log traffic. By default, log traffic is sent to
        stdout. If you set the stream to NULL, no stream will receive the log
        traffic (it may still be sent to the system facility).
        <argument name = "stream" type = "FILE" />
    </method>

    <method name = "set logsender" singleton = "1">
        Sends log output to a PUB socket bound to the specified endpoint. To
        collect such log output, create a SUB socket, subscribe to the traffic
        you care about, and connect to the endpoint. Log traffic is sent as a
        single string frame, in the same format as when sent to stdout. The
        log system supports a single sender; multiple calls to this method will
        bind the same sender to multiple endpoints. To disable the sender, call
        this method with a null argument.
        <argument name = "endpoint" type = "string" />
    </method>

    <method name = "set logsystem" singleton = "1">
        Enable or disable logging to the system facility (syslog on POSIX boxes,
        event log on Windows). By default this is disabled.
        <argument name = "logsystem" type = "boolean" />
    </method>

    <method name = "error" singleton = "1" polymorphic = "1">
        Log error condition - highest priority
        <argument name = "format" type = "string" variadic = "1" />
    </method>

    <method name = "warning" singleton = "1" polymorphic = "1">
        Log warning condition - high priority
        <argument name = "format" type = "string" variadic = "1" />
    </method>

    <method name = "notice" singleton = "1" polymorphic = "1">
        Log normal, but significant, condition - normal priority
        <argument name = "format" type = "string" variadic = "1" />
    </method>

    <method name = "info" singleton = "1" polymorphic = "1">
        Log informational message - low priority
        <argument name = "format" type = "string" variadic = "1" />
    </method>

    <method name = "debug" singleton = "1" polymorphic = "1">
        Log debug-level message - lowest priority
        <argument name = "format" type = "string" variadic = "1" />
    </method>
</class>
