<class name = "zsock">
    high-level socket API that hides libzmq contexts and sockets

    <include filename = "../license.xml" />

    <constructor>
        Create a new socket. Returns the new socket, or NULL if the new socket
        could not be created. Note that the symbol zsock_new (and other
        constructors/destructors for zsock) are redirected to the *_checked
        variant, enabling intelligent socket leak detection. This can have
        performance implications if you use a LOT of sockets. To turn off this
        redirection behaviour, define ZSOCK_NOCHECK.

    </constructor>

    <destructor>
        Destroy the socket. You must use this for any socket created via the
        zsock_new method.

    </method>

    <method name = "bind">
        Bind a socket to a formatted endpoint. For tcp:// endpoints, supports
        ephemeral ports, if you specify the port number as "*". By default
        zsock uses the IANA designated range from C000 (49152) to FFFF (65535).
        To override this range, follow the "*" with "[first-last]". Either or
        both first and last may be empty. To bind to a random port within the
        range, use "!" in place of "*".

        Examples:
            tcp://127.0.0.1:*           bind to first free port from C000 up
            tcp://127.0.0.1:!           bind to random port from C000 to FFFF
            tcp://127.0.0.1:*[60000-]   bind to first free port from 60000 up
            tcp://127.0.0.1:![-60000]   bind to random port from C000 to 60000
            tcp://127.0.0.1:![55000-55999]
                                        bind to random port from 55000 to 55999

        On success, returns the actual port number used, for tcp:// endpoints,
        and 0 for other transports. On failure, returns -1. Note that when using
        ephemeral ports, a port may be reused by different services without
        clients being aware. Protocols that run on ephemeral ports should take
        this into account.
        <argument name = "format" type = "format" />
        <return type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "endpoint">
        Returns last bound endpoint, if any.
        <return type = "string" />
    </method>

    <method name = "unbind">
        Unbind a socket from a formatted endpoint.
        Returns 0 if OK, -1 if the endpoint was invalid or the function
        isn't supported.
        <argument name = "format" type = "format" />
        <return type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "connect">
        Connect a socket to a formatted endpoint
        Returns 0 if OK, -1 if the endpoint was invalid.
        <argument name = "format" type = "format" />
        <return type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "disconnect">
        Disconnect a socket from a formatted endpoint
        Returns 0 if OK, -1 if the endpoint was invalid or the function
        isn't supported.
        <argument name = "format" type = "format" />
        <return type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "attach">
        Attach a socket to zero or more endpoints. If endpoints is not null,
        parses as list of ZeroMQ endpoints, separated by commas, and prefixed by
        '@' (to bind the socket) or '>' (to attach the socket). Returns 0 if all
        endpoints were valid, or -1 if there was a syntax error. If the endpoint
        does not start with '@' or '>', the serverish argument defines whether
        it is used to bind (serverish = true) or connect (serverish = false).
        <argument name = "endpoints" type = "string" />
        <argument name = "serverish" type = "boolean" />
        <return type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "type str">
        Returns socket type as printable constant string.
        <return type = "string" />
    </method>

    <method name = "send" polymorphic = "1">
        Send a 'picture' message to the socket (or actor). The picture is a
        string that defines the type of each frame. This makes it easy to send
        a complex multiframe message in one call. The picture can contain any
        of these characters, each corresponding to one or two arguments:

            i = int (signed)
            1 = uint8_t
            2 = uint16_t
            4 = uint32_t
            8 = uint64_t
            b = byte *, size_t (2 arguments)
            c = zchunk_t *
            f = zframe_t *
            h = zhashx_t *
            p = void * (sends the pointer value, only meaningful over inproc)
            m = zmsg_t * (sends all frames in the zmsg)
            z = sends zero-sized frame (0 arguments)
            u = uint (deprecated)

        Note that s, b, c, and f are encoded the same way and the choice is
        offered as a convenience to the sender, which may or may not already
        have data in a zchunk or zframe. Does not change or take ownership of
        any arguments. Returns 0 if successful, -1 if sending failed for any
        reason.
        <argument name = "picture" type = "string" />
        <argument variadic = "1" />
        <return type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "vsend" polymorphic = "1">
        Send a 'picture' message to the socket (or actor). This is a va_list
        version of zsock_send (), so please consult its documentation for the
        details.
        <argument name = "picture" type = "string" />
        <argument name = "argptr" type = "va_list" />
        <return type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "recv" polymorphic = "1">
        Receive a 'picture' message to the socket (or actor). See zsock_send for
        the format and meaning of the picture. Returns the picture elements into
        a series of pointers as provided by the caller:

            i = int * (stores signed integer)
            4 = uint32_t * (stores 32-bit unsigned integer)
            8 = uint64_t * (stores 64-bit unsigned integer)
            s = char ** (allocates new string)
            b = byte **, size_t * (2 arguments) (allocates memory)
            c = zchunk_t ** (creates zchunk)
            f = zframe_t ** (creates zframe)
            p = void ** (stores pointer)
            h = zhashx_t ** (creates zhashx)
            m = zmsg_t ** (creates a zmsg with the remaing frames)
            z = null, asserts empty frame (0 arguments)
            u = uint * (stores unsigned integer, deprecated)

        Note that zsock_recv creates the returned objects, and the caller must
        destroy them when finished with them. The supplied pointers do not need
        to be initialized. Returns 0 if successful, or -1 if it failed to recv
        a message, in which case the pointers are not modified. When message
        frames are truncated (a short message), sets return values to zero/null.
        If an argument pointer is NULL, does not store any value (skips it).
        An 'n' picture matches an empty frame; if the message does not match,
        the method will return -1.

    <method name = "bsend" polymorphic = "1">
        Send a binary encoded 'picture' message to the socket (or actor). This
        method is similar to zsock_send, except the arguments are encoded in a
        binary format that is compatible with zproto, and is designed to reduce
        memory allocations. The pattern argument is a string that defines the
        type of each argument. Supports these argument types:

         pattern    C type                  zproto type:
            1       uint8_t                 type = "number" size = "1"

            p       void *, sends pointer value, only over inproc

        Does not change or take ownership of any arguments. Returns 0 if
        successful, -1 if sending failed for any reason.

    <method name = "brecv" polymorphic = "1">
        Receive a binary encoded 'picture' message from the socket (or actor).
        This method is similar to zsock_recv, except the arguments are encoded
        in a binary format that is compatible with zproto, and is designed to
        reduce memory allocations. The pattern argument is a string that defines
        the type of each argument. See zsock_bsend for the supported argument
        types. All arguments must be pointers; this call sets them to point to
        values held on a per-socket basis. Do not modify or destroy the returned
        values. Returns 0 if successful, or -1 if it failed to read a message.
        <argument name = "picture" type = "string" />
        <argument variadic = "1" />
        <return type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "set unbounded" polymorphic = "1">
        Set socket to use unbounded pipes (HWM=0); use this in cases when you are
        totally certain the message volume can fit in memory. This method works
        across all versions of ZeroMQ. Takes a polymorphic socket reference.
    </method>

    <method name = "signal" polymorphic = "1">
        Send a signal over a socket. A signal is a short message carrying a
        success/failure code (by convention, 0 means OK). Signals are encoded
        to be distinguishable from "normal" messages. Accepts a zock_t or a
        zactor_t argument, and returns 0 if successful, -1 if the signal could
        not be sent. Takes a polymorphic socket reference.
        <argument name = "status" type = "byte" />
        <return type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "wait" polymorphic = "1">
        Wait on a signal. Use this to coordinate between threads, over pipe
        pairs. Blocks until the signal is received. Returns -1 on error, 0 or
        greater on success. Accepts a zsock_t or a zactor_t as argument.
        Takes a polymorphic socket reference.
        <return type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "flush" polymorphic = "1">
        If there is a partial message still waiting on the socket, remove and
        discard it. This is useful when reading partial messages, to get specific
        message types.
    </method>

    <method name = "is" singleton = "1">
        Probe the supplied object, and report if it looks like a zsock_t.

        Probe the supplied reference. If it looks like a zsock_t instance, return
        the underlying libzmq socket handle; else if it looks like a file
        descriptor, return NULL; else if it looks like a libzmq socket handle,
        return the supplied value. Takes a polymorphic socket reference.
