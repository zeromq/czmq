    <method name = "print" exclude = "1" />

    <method name = "first">
        Return the item at the head of list. If the list is empty, returns NULL.
        Leaves cursor pointing at the head item, or NULL if the list is empty.
        <return type = "anything" />
    </method>

    <method name = "next">
        Return the next item. If the list is empty, returns NULL. To move to
        the start of the list call zlist_first (). Advances the cursor.
        <return type = "anything" />
    </method>

    <method name = "last">
        Return the item at the tail of list. If the list is empty, returns NULL.
        Leaves cursor pointing at the tail item, or NULL if the list is empty.
        <return type = "anything" />
    </method>

    <method name = "head">
        Return first item in the list, or null, leaves the cursor
        <return type = "anything" />
    </method>

    <method name = "tail">
        Return last item in the list, or null, leaves the cursor
        <return type = "anything" />
    </method>

    <method name = "item">
        Return the current item of list. If the list is empty, returns NULL.
        Leaves cursor pointing at the current item, or NULL if the list is empty.
        <return type = "anything" />
    </method>

    <method name = "append">
        Append an item to the end of the list, return 0 if OK or -1 if this
        failed for some reason (out of memory). Note that if a duplicator has 
        been set, this method will also duplicate the item.
        <argument name = "item" type = "anything" />
        <return type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "push">
        Push an item to the start of the list, return 0 if OK or -1 if this
        failed for some reason (out of memory). Note that if a duplicator has
        been set, this method will also duplicate the item.
        <argument name = "item" type = "anything" />
        <return type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "pop">
        Pop the item off the start of the list, if any
        <return type = "anything" />
    </method>

    <method name = "remove">
        Remove the specified item from the list if present
        <argument name = "item" type = "anything" />
    </method>

    <method name = "dup">
        Make a copy of list. If the list has autofree set, the copied list will
        duplicate all items, which must be strings. Otherwise, the list will hold
        pointers back to the items in the original list.
        <return type = "zlist" fresh = "1" />
    </method>

    <method name = "purge">
        Purge all items from list
    </method>

    <method name = "size">
        Return number of items in the list
        <return type = "size" />
    </method>

    <method name = "sort">
        Sort the list by ascending key value using a straight ASCII comparison.
        The sort is not stable, so may reorder items with the same keys.
        <argument name = "compare" type = "zlist_compare_fn" callback = "1" />
    </method>

    <method name = "autofree">
        Set list for automatic item destruction; item values MUST be strings.
        By default a list item refers to a value held elsewhere. When you set
        this, each time you append or push a list item, zlist will take a copy
        of the string value. Then, when you destroy the list, it will free all
        item values automatically. If you use any other technique to allocate
        list values, you must free them explicitly before destroying the list.
        The usual technique is to pop list items and destroy them, until the
        list is empty.
    </method>

    <method name = "freefn">
        Set a free function for the specified list item. When the item is
        destroyed, the free function, if any, is called on that item.
        Use this when list items are dynamically allocated, to ensure that
        you don't have memory leaks. You can pass 'free' or NULL as a free_fn.
        Returns the item, or NULL if there is no such item.
        <argument name = "item" type = "anything" />
        <argument name = "fn" type = "zlist_free_fn" callback = "1" />
        <argument name = "at tail" type = "boolean" />
        <return type = "anything" />
    </method>

    <method name = "test" singleton = "1">
        Self test of this class
        <argument name = "verbose" type = "integer" />
    </method>
</class>
