    <constant name = "more" value = "1" />
    <constant name = "reuse" value = "2" />
    <constant name = "dontwait" value = "4" />

    <constructor>
        Create a new frame. If size is not null, allocates the frame data
        to the specified size. If additionally, data is not null, copies
        size octets from the specified data into the frame body.
        <argument name = "data" type = "anything" constant = "1" />
        <argument name = "size" type = "size" />
    </constructor>

    <destructor>
        Destroy a frame
    </destructor>

    <method name = "new empty" singleton = "1">
        Create an empty (zero-sized) frame
        <return type = "zframe" fresh = "1" />
    </method>

    <method name = "recv" singleton = "1">
        Receive frame from socket, returns zframe_t object or NULL if the recv
        was interrupted. Does a blocking recv, if you want to not block then use
        zpoller or zloop.
        <argument name = "source" type = "anything" />
        <return type = "zframe" fresh = "1" />
    </method>

    <method name = "send" singleton = "1">
        Send a frame to a socket, destroy frame after sending.
        Return -1 on error, 0 on success.
        <argument name = "self_p" type = "zframe" by_reference = "1" />
        <argument name = "dest" type = "anything" />

        Return address of frame data
        <return type = "buffer" constant = "0" />
    </method>

    <method name = "dup">
        Create a new frame that duplicates an existing frame. If frame is null,
        or memory was exhausted, returns null.
        <return type = "zframe" fresh = "1" />
    </method>

    <method name = "strhex">
        Return frame data encoded as printable hex string, useful for 0MQ UUIDs.
        Caller must free string when finished with it.
        <return type = "string" fresh = "1" />
    </method>

    <method name = "strdup">
        Return frame data copied into freshly allocated string
        Caller must free string when finished with it.
        <return type = "string" fresh = "1" />
    </method>

    <method name = "streq">
        Return TRUE if frame body is equal to string, excluding terminator
        <argument name = "string" type = "string" />
        <return type = "boolean" />
    </method>

    <method name = "more">
        Return frame MORE indicator (1 or 0), set when reading frame from socket
        or by the zframe_set_more() method
        <return type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "set more">
        Set frame MORE indicator (1 or 0). Note this is NOT used when sending 
        frame to socket, you have to specify flag explicitly.
        <argument name = "more" type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "eq">
        Return TRUE if two frames have identical size and data
        If either frame is NULL, equality is always false.
        <argument name = "other" type = "zframe" />
        <return type = "boolean" />
    </method>

    <method name = "reset">
        Set new contents for frame
        <argument name = "data" type = "anything" constant = "1" />
        <argument name = "size" type = "size" />
    </method>

    <method name = "print">
        Send message to zsys log sink (may be stdout, or system facility as
        configured by zsys_set_logstream). Prefix shows before frame, if not null.
        <argument name = "prefix" type = "string" />
    </method>

    <method name = "is" singleton = "1">
        Probe the supplied object, and report if it looks like a zframe_t.
        <argument name = "self" type = "anything" />
        <return type = "boolean" />
    </method>

    <method name = "test" singleton = "1">
        Self test of this class
        <argument name = "verbose" type = "boolean" />
    </method>
