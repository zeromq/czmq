@header
    The zthread class wraps OS thread creation. It creates detached threads
    that look like normal OS threads, or attached threads that share the
    caller's 0MQ context, and get a pipe to talk back to the parent thread.
@discuss
    One problem is when our application needs child threads. If we simply
    use pthreads_create() we're faced with several issues. First, it's not
    portable to legacy OSes like win32. Second, how can a child thread get
    access to our zctx object? If we just pass it around, we'll end up
    sharing the pipe socket (which we use to talk to the agent) between
    threads, and that will then crash 0MQ. Sockets cannot be used from more
    than one thread at a time.

    So each child thread needs its own pipe to the agent. For the agent,
    this is fine, it can talk to a million threads. But how do we create
    those pipes in the child thread? We can't, not without help from the
    main thread. The solution is to wrap thread creation, like we wrap
    socket creation. To create a new thread, the app calls zctx_thread_new()
    and this method creates a dedicated zctx object, with a pipe, and then
    it passes that object to the newly minted child thread.

    The neat thing is we can hide non-portable aspects. Windows is really a
    mess when it comes to threads. Three different APIs, none of which is
    really right, so you have to do rubbish like manually cleaning up when
    a thread finishes. Anyhow, it's hidden in this class so you don't need
    to worry.

    Second neat thing about wrapping thread creation is we can make it a
    more enriching experience for all involved. One thing I do often is use
    a PAIR-PAIR pipe to talk from a thread to/from its parent. So this class
    will automatically create such a pair for each thread you start.
