The following ABNF grammar defines the ZeroMQ Gossip Protocol:

        C:HELLO [ *S:PUBLISH ]
        C:PUBLISH / S:PUBLISH / C:PING S:PONG

    ;         Client says hello to server
    hello           = signature %d1 version
    signature       = %xAA %xA0             ; two octets
    version         = number-1              ; Version = 1

    ;         Client or server announces a new tuple
    publish         = signature %d2 version key value ttl
    version         = number-1              ; Version = 1
    key             = string                ; Tuple key, globally unique
    value           = longstr               ; Tuple value, as printable string
    ttl             = number-4              ; Time to live, msecs

    ;         Client signals liveness
    ping            = signature %d3 version
    version         = number-1              ; Version = 1

    ;         Server responds to ping
    pong            = signature %d4 version
    version         = number-1              ; Version = 1

    ;         Server rejects command as invalid
    invalid         = signature %d5 version
    version         = number-1              ; Version = 1

    ; Strings are always length + text contents
    string          = number-1 *VCHAR
    longstr         = number-4 *VCHAR

    ; Numbers are unsigned integers in network byte order
    number-1        = 1OCTET
    number-4        = 4OCTET
