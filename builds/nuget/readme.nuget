NuGet is a package management system for MS-Windows.
It is similar in spirit to tools like Maven or Gradle.

It was originaly for .Net only packages but it has 
recently been augmented to working with native packages.

The instructions for building a NuGet package can be found here:
http://coapp.org/pages/tutorials.html


The basic procedure is to first build all 
the artifacts and then run ...
 Write-NuGetPackage .\czmq.autopkg 

The *.nuget files thus produced can then be installed
in a local repository or uploaded to one of the nuget servers.
