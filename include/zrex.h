//  Constructor. Optionally, sets an expression against which we can match

//  zrex_valid() as false and provides the error in zrex_strerror(). If you
//  set a pattern, you can call zrex_hits() to test it against text.

//  Matches the text against a previously set expression, and reports the

//  not match, returns 0. If it matches, returns 1 or greater, depending on
//  how many "(...)" groups the expression has. An expression with one group
//  will produce 2 hits, one for the whole expression and one for the group.
//  To retrieve the individual hits, call zrex_hit ().

//  Matches the text against a new expression, and reports the number of

//  is always the whole matching string. Sequence 1 is the first capture
//  group, if any, and so on.
