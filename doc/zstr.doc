#### zstr - sending and receiving strings

The zstr class provides utility functions for sending and receiving C
strings across 0MQ sockets. It sends strings without a terminating null,
and appends a null byte on received strings. This class is for simple
message sending.


This is the class interface:

    //  Receive C string from socket. Caller must free returned string using
    //  zstr_free(). Returns NULL if the context is being terminated or the
    //  process was interrupted.
    CZMQ_EXPORT char *
        zstr_recv (void *source);
    
    //  Send a C string to a socket, as a frame. The string is sent without
    //  trailing null byte; to read this you can use zstr_recv, or a similar
    //  method that adds a null terminator on the received string. String
    //  may be NULL, which is sent as "".
    CZMQ_EXPORT int
        zstr_send (void *dest, const char *string);
    
    //  Send a C string to a socket, as zstr_send(), with a MORE flag, so that
    //  you can send further strings in the same multi-part message.
    CZMQ_EXPORT int
        zstr_sendm (void *dest, const char *string);
    
    //  Send a formatted string to a socket. Note that you should NOT use
    //  user-supplied strings in the format (they may contain '%' which
    //  will create security holes).
    CZMQ_EXPORT int
        zstr_sendf (void *dest, const char *format, ...);
    
    //  Send a formatted string to a socket, as for zstr_sendf(), with a
    //  MORE flag, so that you can send further strings in the same multi-part
    //  message.
    CZMQ_EXPORT int
        zstr_sendfm (void *dest, const char *format, ...);
    
    //  Send a series of strings (until NULL) as multipart data
    //  Returns 0 if the strings could be sent OK, or -1 on error.
    CZMQ_EXPORT int
        zstr_sendx (void *dest, const char *string, ...);
    
    //  Receive a series of strings (until NULL) from multipart data.
    //  Each string is allocated and filled with string data; if there
    //  are not enough frames, unallocated strings are set to NULL.
    //  Returns -1 if the message could not be read, else returns the
    //  number of strings filled, zero or more. Free each returned string
    //  using zstr_free(). If not enough strings are provided, remaining
    //  multipart frames in the message are dropped.
    CZMQ_EXPORT int
        zstr_recvx (void *source, char **string_p, ...);
    
    //  Free a provided string, and nullify the parent pointer. Safe to call on
    //  a null pointer.
    CZMQ_EXPORT void
        zstr_free (char **string_p);
    
    //  Self test of this class
    CZMQ_EXPORT void
        zstr_test (bool verbose);

This is the class self test code:

    //  Create two PAIR sockets and connect over inproc
