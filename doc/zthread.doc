#### zthread - working with system threads (deprecated)

The zthread class wraps OS thread creation. It creates detached threads
that look like normal OS threads, or attached threads that share the
caller's 0MQ context, and get an inproc pipe to talk back to the parent
thread. Detached threads create their own 0MQ contexts as needed.
NOTE: this class is deprecated in favor of zactor.

We have several use cases for multiple threads. One is to simulate many
processes, so we can test 0MQ designs and flows more easily. Another is
to create APIs that can send and receive 0MQ messages in the background.

zthread solves these two use cases separately, using the zthread_new
and zthead_fork methods respectively. These methods wrap the native
system calls needed to start threads, so your code can remain fully
portable.

Detached threads follow the POSIX pthreads API; they accept a void *
argument and return a void * result (always NULL in our case).

Attached thread receive a void * argument, a zctx_t context, and a pipe
socket. The pipe socket is a PAIR socket that is connected back to the
caller. When you call zthread_fork, it returns you a PAIR socket that
is the other end of this pipe. Thus attached threads can talk back to
their parent threads over the pipe. We use this very heavily when making
so-called "asynchronous" APIs, which you can see in the Guide examples
like 'clone'.

To recap some rules about threading: do not share sockets between
threads or your code will crash. You can migrate a socket from one
thread to a child thread, if you stop using it in the parent thread
immediately after creating the child thread. If you want to connect
sockets over inproc:// they must share the same 0MQ context, i.e. be
attached threads. You should always use zthread_fork to create an
attached thread; it is not sufficient to pass a zctx_t structure to
a detached thread (this will crash).

If you want to communicate over ipc:// or tcp:// you may be sharing
the same context, or use separate contexts. Thus, every detached thread
usually starts by creating its own zctx_t instance.

This is the class interface:

    //  Detached threads follow POSIX pthreads API
    typedef void *(zthread_detached_fn) (void *args);
    
    //  Attached threads get context and pipe from parent
    typedef void (zthread_attached_fn) (void *args, zctx_t *ctx, void *pipe);
    
    //  Create a detached thread. A detached thread operates autonomously
    //  and is used to simulate a separate process. It gets no ctx, and no
    //  pipe.
    CZMQ_EXPORT int
        zthread_new (zthread_detached_fn *thread_fn, void *args);
    
    //  Create an attached thread. An attached thread gets a ctx and a PAIR
    //  pipe back to its parent. It must monitor its pipe, and exit if the
    //  pipe becomes unreadable. Do not destroy the ctx, the thread does this
    //  automatically when it ends.
    CZMQ_EXPORT void *
        zthread_fork (zctx_t *ctx, zthread_attached_fn *thread_fn, void *args);
    
    //  Self test of this class
    CZMQ_EXPORT void
        zthread_test (bool verbose);

This is the class self test code:

    static void *
    s_test_detached (void *args)
    {
    //  Create a socket to check it'll be automatically deleted
    zctx_t *ctx = zctx_new ();
    assert (ctx);
    
    void *push = zsocket_new (ctx, ZMQ_PUSH);
    assert (push);
    zctx_destroy (&ctx);
    return NULL;
    }
    
    static void
    s_test_attached (void *args, zctx_t *ctx, void *pipe)
    {
    //  Create a socket to check it'll be automatically deleted
    zsocket_new (ctx, ZMQ_PUSH);
    assert (ctx);
    //  Wait for our parent to ping us, and pong back
    char *ping = zstr_recv (pipe);
    assert (ping);
    zstr_free (&ping);
    zstr_send (pipe, "pong");
    }
    
    zctx_t *ctx = zctx_new ();
    assert (ctx);
    int rc = 0;
    
    //  Create a detached thread, let it run
    rc = zthread_new (s_test_detached, NULL);
    assert (rc == 0);
    zclock_sleep (100);
    
    //  Create an attached thread, check it's safely alive
    void *pipe = zthread_fork (ctx, s_test_attached, NULL);
    assert (pipe);
    zstr_send (pipe, "ping");
    char *pong = zstr_recv (pipe);
    assert (pong);
    assert (streq (pong, "pong"));
    zstr_free (&pong);
    
    //  Everything should be cleanly closed now
    zctx_destroy (&ctx);
