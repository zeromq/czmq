NAME
----
zsys - system wrapper

SYNOPSIS
--------
----
//  Create a file path if it doesn't exit
CZMQ_EXPORT void
    zsys_mkdir (zsys_t *self, char *pathname);

//  Remove a file path with multiple levels
CZMQ_EXPORT void
    zsys_rmdir (zsys_t *self, char *pathname, bool force);

//  Self test of this class
int
    zsys_test (bool verbose);
----

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The zsys class provides a portable wrapper for miscellaneous functions
that we want to wrap but which don't fit into any of the existing
classes. Eventually all non-portable functionality might be moved here
but for now it covers only file systems.


EXAMPLE
-------
.From zsys_test method
