NAME
----
zcert - work with CURVE security certificates

SYNOPSIS
--------
----

//  Create and initialize a new certificate in memory
CZMQ_EXPORT zcert_t *
    zcert_new (void);

//  Constructor, accepts public/secret key pair from caller
CZMQ_EXPORT zcert_t *
    zcert_new_from (byte *public_key, byte *secret_key);

//  Destroy a certificate in memory
CZMQ_EXPORT void
    zcert_destroy (zcert_t **self_p);

//  Return public part of key pair as 32-byte binary string
CZMQ_EXPORT byte *
    zcert_public_key (zcert_t *self);

//  Return secret part of key pair as 32-byte binary string
CZMQ_EXPORT byte *
    zcert_secret_key (zcert_t *self);

//  Return public part of key pair as Z85 armored string
CZMQ_EXPORT char *
    zcert_public_txt (zcert_t *self);

//  Return secret part of key pair as Z85 armored string
CZMQ_EXPORT char *
    zcert_secret_txt (zcert_t *self);

//  Set certificate metadata from formatted string.
CZMQ_EXPORT void
    zcert_set_meta (zcert_t *self, char *name, char *format, ...);

//  Get metadata value from certificate; if the metadata value doesn't 
//  exist, returns NULL.
CZMQ_EXPORT char *
    zcert_meta (zcert_t *self, char *name);

//  Load certificate from file (constructor)
CZMQ_EXPORT zcert_t *
    zcert_load (char *filename);

//  Save full certificate (public + secret) to file for persistent storage
//  This creates one public file and one secret file (filename + "_secret").
CZMQ_EXPORT int
    zcert_save (zcert_t *self, char *filename);

//  Save public certificate only to file for persistent storage
CZMQ_EXPORT int
    zcert_save_public (zcert_t *self, char *filename);

//  Apply certificate to socket, i.e. use for CURVE security on socket.
//  If certificate was loaded from public file, the secret key will be
//  undefined, and this certificate will not work successfully.
CZMQ_EXPORT void
    zcert_apply (zcert_t *self, void *zocket);

//  Return copy of certificate
CZMQ_EXPORT zcert_t *
    zcert_dup (zcert_t *self);

//  Return true if two certificates have the same keys
CZMQ_EXPORT bool
    zcert_eq (zcert_t *self, zcert_t *compare);

//  Dump certificate contents to stderr for debugging
CZMQ_EXPORT void
    zcert_dump (zcert_t *self);

//  Self test of this class
CZMQ_EXPORT int
    zcert_test (bool verbose);

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The zcert class provides a way to create and work with security
certificates for the ZMQ CURVE mechanism. A certificate contains a
public + secret key pair, plus metadata. It can be used as a
temporary object in memory, or persisted to disk. On disk, a
certificate is stored as two files. One is public and contains only
the public key. The second is secret and contains both keys. The
two have the same filename, with the secret file adding "_secret".
To exchange certificates, send the public file via some secure route. 
Certificates are not signed but are text files that can be verified by 
eye.

Certificates are stored in the ZPL (ZMQ RFC 4) format. They have two
sections, "metadata" and "curve". The first contains a list of 'name =
value' pairs, one per line. Values may be enclosed in quotes. The curve
section has a 'public-key = keyvalue' and, for secret certificates, a
'secret-key = keyvalue' line. The keyvalue is a Z85-encoded CURVE key.

EXAMPLE
-------
.From zcert_test method
----
    //  Create temporary directory for test files
#   define TESTDIR ".test_zcert"
    zsys_dir_create (TESTDIR);
    
    //  Create a simple certificate with metadata
    zcert_t *cert = zcert_new ();
